Some examples of inputs and outputs of the DFA minimization program.

Each input file inp.X corresponds to output file out.X

Notes:

	The start state is always called 's0'

	states in general are maked 'sN', i.e. the letter 's'
	followed by some number.

	Accepting states are marked 'AN', i.e the letter 'A'
	followed by some number.

	For convenience, the input symbols are called 'a', 'b', 'c', ...

	The input matrices may be sparse: undefined transitions
	(illegal input to a certain state) are marked by a '-' (dash)
	Going into an illegal state means that the input word is not
	in the language defined by the DFA.
